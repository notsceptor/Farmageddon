# Farmageddon

Farmageddon is an innovative, tower defense farming game designed to be procedurally ever lasting. Hosting a roster of unique, crop themed turrets and an even crazier enemy arsenal, Farmageddon aims to be a casual yet competitive idle game to play on the go. 

Utilising a randomised wave pathing algorithm, an infinitely procedural wave and turret upgrade difficulty system and some spanners thrown around somewhere, Farmageddon will be the latest tower defense app for Android providing a unique experience each and every time you play.
